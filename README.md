# Reaction Time in Rationally Redundant Referring Expressions
### Response to Engelhardt (2011)

#### Engelhardt 2011
- Experimental setup
	-  visual displays with two stimuli
	-  referential expressions as auditory cue
	-  time starts with modifier onset
	-  stimuli were not color-diagnostic
	-  reaction time was counted, when button was pressed, indicating which of the two objects was the target
-  Result
	-  reaction time higher when modifier is used overinformatively than informatively
-  Potential problems
	-  didn't use color-diagnostic stimuli (the more atypical an object, the more people use a modifier overinformatively -- maybe to correct the listener's visual search; a listener doesn't have a high expectation on what color a circle might have which could cause looking for a contrast set)
	-  very low scene variation

#### Our experiment
- Open questions
	- auditory cue?
	- amount of objects in the scene
	- same stimuli as in typicality study?
	- how to encode selection of an item (which keys to press)
	- when to identify time onset?
